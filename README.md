# Grade-Calculator 2007
This program is written in Python and was a practice on writing basic GUI's with Tkinter. 
This program generates pairs of entry boxes from a user-given numeric value to calculate a number of weighted grades. The program does not store data or the grades entered in a separate file. The user input is stored in working memory as an array and as the program traverses the array, the calculated values are stored in a variable and accumulates to obtain the final average.
