# Portfolio
This program generates pairs of entry boxes from a given numeric value to calculate grades of differing weights. The program does not store data or the grades entered in a separate file. The user input is stored in working memory as an array and as the program traverses the array, the calculated values are stored in a variable and accumulates to obtain the final average.
