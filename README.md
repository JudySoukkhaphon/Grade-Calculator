# Grade-Calculator 2007
This was a practice on using Tkinter, traversing arrays, and taking user input.

Pairs of entry-boxes are created based on the number of grades that the user wants to calulate. The entry-box pairs takes a grade and its weight. The value for each weighted grade is accumulated and displayed in the GUI.
